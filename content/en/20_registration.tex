\section{Registration}

All participating clubs need to register using the “LENEX” Format for standardized data transfer. Please submit registration as UTF-8 text file by e-mail or via electronic medium. When sending an electronic medium, please attach a hard copy of your registration. Registration without reporting times or false information will be rejected. According to the DSV competition regulations the registration must also include the statement about the athlete's health.

The organizer reserves the right to reject registrations, to change the start times and/or to reschedule individual events. In the 200 m races, a maximum of 3 heats will be admitted – in 200 m individual Medley a maximum of 5 heats per day will be admitted. The athletes with the fastest reporting times will be swimming based on best performances since \athleteBestDateEN. For the 200 m distance the reporting time will be compared to the ranking of DSV by the referee.
 
\textbf{Registration deadline is Tuesday, \registrationDeadlineEN.} Post-deadline registration and changing registrations are not possible. In order to ensure a fast course of events, \textbf{please notify us about sick athletes until Thursday, \deregistrationDeadlineEN} by e-mail. All participating clubs will receive a confirmation of their registrations. You will also be informed in case of rejected registrations and if the start times have changed until Sunday, \entryConfirmationDateEN.

The heat organization for each age group takes place according to reporting times. The heat organization of the 200 m distances will take place based on reporting times only. For the 100 m distance we have Limits.
  
All participating teams of 5 athletes or more, or 20 or more starts, are obliged to provide a swimming judge or a referee to own costs. Teams of 21 athletes or more, or 100 or more starts are required to provide 2 swimming judges. The judge/referee registration has to be made until the deadline including the stage of qualification, the name as well as preferred assignment.  All referees will receive free food and an event t-shirt free of charge.

The results report and the protocol as a hardcopy will only be prepared if requested during registration. Both, results and protocols will be available online on the website \textbf{erzgebirgsschwimmcup.de}. and in the \textbf{SwimResults app}.
