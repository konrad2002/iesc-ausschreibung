\section{Registration}

All participating clubs need to register using the “LENEX” Format for standardized data transfer. Please submit registration as UTF-8 text file by e-mail or via electronic medium. When sending an electronic medium, please attach a hard copy of your registration. Registration without reporting times or false information will be rejected. According to the DSV competition regulations the registration must also include the statement about the athlete’s health.

The organizer reserves the right to reject registrations, to change the start times and/or to reschedule individual events. In the 200 m races, a maximum of 3 heats will be admitted – in 200 m individual Medley a maximum of 5 heats per day will be admitted. The athletes with the fastest reporting times will be swimming based on best performances since January 1st, 2024.
