Both honors are eternal challenge cups. Because it is the 28th time that the IESC will occur we will honor the best team with 150 Euros, the second-best team with 100 Euros and the third-best team with 50 Euros as an anniversary present. The ranking after all scoring events will count. The award ceremony is part of the competition. If you do not attend the ceremony, you forfeit all honors.
